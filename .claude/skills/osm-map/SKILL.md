# OSM map pipeline — deep detail

This is the detail layer behind the **OSM map pipeline** summary in `CONTEXT.md`:
how the downloaded data becomes `MapData` and pixels.

Four deep dives live next to this file and are read on demand:

- `references/osm-coverage.md` — the **tag coverage audit** (in Russian): which OSM
  tags reach the map, which are downloaded and thrown away, which are never asked for,
  with per-city counts, and how to regenerate them (`tools/osm_audit/`). Read it
  before widening the Overpass query — a feature that already exists must not get
  "added" twice. Widening the query or adding a `parse_way` branch means updating it
  in the same change.
- `references/entrances.md` — the door generator: the measured statistics behind the
  cohort table, the pitch law, blocked walls, determinism.
- `references/trees.md` — planting (woods, standalone, rows, density/thresholds) and
  rendering (crowns, TreeStyle/TreeRowStyle, conifer stands).
- `references/tree-algo.md` — the watabou Village Generator crown algorithm (in
  Russian), reverse-engineered from `Village.js`; the ground truth `map/trees/crown.rs`
  is written against.

When a change here introduces or retires a concept, update the matching summary bullet
in `CONTEXT.md` and the detail here in the same change.

## Download & cache

- **Overpass** — the Overpass API (`overpass-api.de`), queried once with `[out:json]` +
  `out geom` (inline geometry, no node lookup). Query covers: `building` (way+rel),
  `highway` (way), `natural=water` / `waterway=riverbank` (way+rel),
  `waterway=river|stream|brook|canal|ditch|drain|weir` (way — the *linear* watercourses),
  `leisure=park|garden`,
  `landuse=recreation_ground|forest` + `natural=wood`, `natural=tree_row` (way),
  `natural=tree` (node), `landuse=grass|meadow` / `natural=grassland|meadow`,
  `natural=sand|beach`, `barrier=city_wall`. The bbox is `MAP_SIZE` around the selected
  `City`'s geo center. `QUERY_VERSION` is **7** (v3 added `entrance` nodes, v4 `railway`,
  v5 `natural=tree_row`, v6 `natural=tree` nodes, v7 linear `waterway`).
- **Mirrors** — `OVERPASS_URLS` in `download.rs` is tried in order (`maps.mail.ru` →
  `overpass-api.de` → `kumi.systems` → `private.coffee`). The VK/Mail.ru instance leads:
  full planet, current data, and the nearest pipe from here — Berlin took 19 s through it
  against ~2.5 min and two 504s through the European ones. On dense cities those answer
  504 "server too busy", or worse, a **200 with an HTML error page** — hence the
  "response must start with `{`" check before a mirror is considered successful.
- **Cache** — `assets/osm/tula_{lat}_{lon}_{w}x{h}_v{QUERY_VERSION}.json` (gitignored).
  Parameters live in the file name, so changing settings invalidates it; **bump
  `QUERY_VERSION` in `overpass.rs` whenever the query gains tags**, or every existing
  cache keeps serving an extract that lacks them. Written **only after successful
  parse**; a broken cache self-heals (deleted, re-downloaded). Second launch never
  touches the network.
- **One file per city** — every load first runs `prune_stale_caches()`: anything under a
  known city slug that is not that city's current `cache_path` is deleted. That is what
  retires extracts left by an old geo center, `MAP_SIZE` or `QUERY_VERSION` — tens of MB
  each. It sweeps **all** cities, not just the one being loaded, so junk under a city
  nobody visits still goes; the current file of each city survives, so a tour of the six
  is not six downloads per lap.

## MapData — the parsed model

`map/osm/model.rs`; the resource stays resident after spawn.

- **PolyArea** — polygon with holes; rings are open (no repeated last point).
  `AreaKind: Building | Kremlin | Water | Park | Wood | Grass | Sand`. **Park** is the
  light base fill; **Wood** (`natural=wood` / `landuse=forest`) are the darker stands
  *inside* it and the **only** areas that carry trees; **Grass** (lawns, meadows) and
  **Sand** (beaches) also sit above the park fill, lighter green / sandy. Everything
  but Wood stays open ground — that is what makes the open half of a park read as a
  field, the way it does on OSM.
  `height: Option<f32>` — metres, buildings only (`None` on water/parks even if the
  tag is there). See **Building height** below. `entrances: Vec<Vec2>` — the OSM
  doors on this building's outline, empty for most buildings; see
  `references/entrances.md`.
- **RoadLine** — centerline polyline + width by highway class (primary 16 → footway
  3.5). `RoadClass: Street | Alley` (alleys = footways, park paths; different color and
  z). `bridge` and `passage` flags — the navmesh carves (see the navigation-deep
  skill); `bridge` also moves the road into the bridge deck layers (see **Bridge
  layers** below).
  **Underground road is dropped** (`parse/tags.rs::is_road_underground`) — the same rule rails
  and watercourses have always had, and it was simply missing on the highway branch:
  metro concourses and stairs came out as ordinary alleys drawn over the city (Tokyo
  1053 of 12 859 ways — 8.2%; London 1808, Paris 1343, Berlin 787, Tula 34; counts in
  `references/osm-coverage.md`). It is a **separate predicate** from `is_underground`,
  and the reason is that **the risk is asymmetric here**: an extra ribbon is cosmetic,
  an extra deletion is a hole in the navmesh, because roads are exactly what carves it.
  So the rule stands down wherever the tag may not be describing the road — a `bridge`
  or an arch (`is_building_passage`), both of which exist at walking level by the very
  role that carves the navmesh, and `tunnel=culvert`, which belongs to the *stream*
  piped under the street (and for that stream it must keep meaning "underground", or the
  pipe walls off the navmesh). All three exclusions are pinned by tests; the blunt
  version cost Tokyo 331 arches and 17 bridges, London 177 arches. Verified live on
  Tula: `navmesh: pruned 9898` before and after — the navmesh did not move.
- **RailLine** — `railway=*` centerline + width by value (`rail` 5 → `light_rail` /
  `narrow_gauge` / `subway` 4 → `tram` 1.2). `RailKind: Active | Tram | Disused` — the
  kind *is* the drawing style, not a label: **Tram** is a thin line with cross ties
  (see **Tram** below — its width from parse is ignored, the zoom LOD picks it),
  **Disused** (`abandoned` / `disused` / `razed` / `dismantled`)
  is the `Active` ribbon washed out. A tram runs *on* the carriageway, so a
  gauge-wide ribbon would cover its own street.
  `parse/tags.rs::rail_class` is a
  **whitelist**, so the station vocabulary (`platform`, `station`, `switch`, `signal`,
  `construction`, …) never becomes a line. The rail branch in `parse_way` runs *before*
  the highway branch and deliberately **falls through**: an OSM way is routinely tagged
  both `railway=tram` and `highway=*`, and such a way is both a street and a track.
  **Underground track is dropped** (`parse/tags.rs::is_underground`) — a metro tunnel or a
  sunken through-line is invisible from above. Both markers are needed, neither alone
  suffices: of Tula's three underground ways two carry `tunnel=yes` *and* `layer=-1`,
  the third only `layer=-1`. `tunnel=no` is an explicit no, and elevated track
  (`layer` ≥ 0, no tunnel) still draws — that is what keeps an elevated subway on the
  map. **Rails never touch the navmesh** — see the navigation-deep skill.
- **WallLine** — `barrier=city_wall` (the Tula kremlin), 3 m wide, kremlin red,
  impassable.
- **WaterLine** — a *linear* watercourse: `waterway=river` 8 m → `canal` (and `weir`)
  6/4 m → `stream|brook` 2.5 m → `ditch|drain` 1.5 m, water blue, one merged ribbon at
  `Z_WATERWAY`. Widths are drawing widths, not hydrology: OSM draws as a line what is
  too narrow for a polygon, so a `river` line is narrower than the Упа (which is an
  area). A plausible `width` tag (`WATER_WIDTH_RANGE`, 0.5..50 m) overrides the class
  default. `parse/tags.rs::water_class` is a **whitelist** for the same reason `rail_class` is:
  `waterway=*` also carries `riverbank` (that one is an area, and `area_kind` claims
  it), `dam`, `dock`, `lock_gate`, `waterfall`. Like the rail and tree-row branches,
  the waterway branch in `parse_way` runs before `highway` and **falls through** — a
  culverted stream under a street shares its way with `highway=*`.
  **`tunnel: bool`** (`parse/tags.rs::is_underground`, the same test that drops subway track)
  marks a piped section: it is **not drawn at all** and, alone among
  watercourses, **does not block the navmesh** — the water runs under the ground and a
  pawn walks over it, so there is nothing to see and nothing to cross. Everything else
  about waterways *does* block; see the navigation-deep skill.
  A **culvert portal** — the node where an open way ends against the end of a piped one
  (`model::water_line_caps`) — is where the channel is cut **flat**. Everywhere else an
  open end is capped with a half-disk of half the channel width, because OSM splits one
  channel into several ways and the two caps meeting in a shared node fuse the joint;
  past a portal there is no more water, and the half-disk would jut into dry land and
  (the grid fill measures the same distance-to-segment) plug the culvert mouth with a
  semicircle of blocked tiles. One rule, both layers: `spawn::mesh_water_lines` and
  `Navmesh::fill_from_mapdata`.
- **TreeRow** — `natural=tree_row`: an avenue's centerline polyline plus what the data
  itself knows about the planting — `spacing: Option<f32>` (from `spacing`, or the row
  length spread over `count` / `tree:count`) and `radius: Option<f32>` (half
  `diameter_crown`). Both are rare, semi-standard tags, so almost every row is
  `None`/`None` and falls back to the density slider. Like the rail branch, the
  `tree_row` branch in `parse_way` runs before `highway` and **falls through**.
- **TreeNode** — `natural=tree` node: a single surveyed tree, position plus
  `radius: Option<f32>` (half `diameter_crown`, same parse as on rows). Raw input for
  `planting::plant_standalone`; see `references/trees.md`.
- **wood_trees / row_trees_kept / row_trees_slid** — `(pos, radius, appears_at)`,
  each sorted by threshold: the forest (with standalone surveyed trees at threshold 0
  in front), and the avenues under each placement policy.
  Raw material, not what the renderer reads.
- **trees** / **tree_appears_at** — what the renderer reads: `MapData::compose_trees`
  merges the forest with the avenues of the selected policy (a merge, not a sort — both
  inputs are already ordered). `composed_for` records which policy it was built for;
  it lives on `MapData` rather than in a system `Local` precisely because a city switch
  replaces the whole resource, and a `Local` would survive it and skip the rebuild.

## Parsing details

- **Building height** (`parse/tags.rs::building_height`) — metres, from two *independent*
  branches of OSM data that almost never co-occur: `height` verbatim (New York — 97%, a
  LiDAR import) or else `building:levels` + `roof:levels` × `METERS_PER_LEVEL` (3 m)
  (Paris 64%, Berlin 59%, London 50%, Tula 31%, **Tokyo 5%**). `parse_measure` handles
  the tag-value zoo — `12`, `12.5`, `12,5`, `12 m`, `3;4`, `40'6"`. Anything outside
  `BUILDING_HEIGHT_RANGE` (2–600 m) counts as *no tag*: OSM carries both `height=0` and
  order-of-magnitude typos. `None` is normal, not an error — every consumer owns a
  default. Coverage is logged per city on load (`N buildings (M with height)`).
- **Drowned buildings** (`parse.rs::drop_buildings_in_water`) — a building whose outline
  lies **entirely** inside a water polygon is dropped right after the element loop, before
  doors and trees. OSM tags floating restaurants and moored ships as buildings (`HMS
  Belfast`, `Café Barge`) and Tula carries a lone shed in the middle of Верхний пруд; the
  navmesh floods water impassable, so their doors are unreachable anyway and the box
  standing on the pond reads as a render bug. One vertex on land is enough to survive —
  piers and embankment houses stay. Counts: Tula 1, Berlin 6, NY 17, London 28, Paris 28,
  Tokyo 0; logged on stderr when non-zero.
- **Ring assembly** (`parse.rs::assemble_rings`) — multipolygon relation members joined
  end-to-end (ε = 0.01 m) into closed rings; chains broken by the bbox edge are
  force-closed if ≥ 3 points. Inner rings become holes of the outer containing them.

## Testing the parse

`parse/tests.rs` is where a tag rule is pinned, and the fixture it uses is
`fixture.rs::Overpass` — a scene stated in **map metres**, turned into an Overpass
response, fed through the real `parse`:

```rust
let map = Overpass::new(CITY)
    .way(&[("railway", "rail")], vec![sw, ne])
    .way(&[("railway", "platform")], vec![sw, ne])       // dropped: whitelist
    .area(&[("natural", "wood")], square(CENTER, 110.0)) // area = closed way
    .node(&[("entrance", "main")], sw)
    .relation(&[("natural", "water")], &[("outer", …), ("inner", …)])
    .parse();
```

Four things about it worth knowing before writing a case:

- **Metres, not degrees.** Points are unprojected with `GeoBounds::unproject`, so a test
  builds its scene in the same numbers it asserts on (`CENTER`, `corners(half)`); the
  round trip is pinned by `unproject_returns_the_point_project_started_from`.
- **It goes through the JSON text**, not around it: deserialization of the Overpass DTO
  is part of what these tests cover. That is why the builder emits a string rather than
  handing `Element`s to an inner function.
- **`area` closes the ring, `way` does not, `relation` members are left as given** —
  OSM cuts an outer ring into several open ways, and assembling one from the pieces is
  itself under test.
- **Scenes are shared** where they repeat: `wood_scene()` (planting rules are checked as
  subtractions from a full wood), `tree_row(tags)`, `fixture()`.

A new tag reaching the map means a case here — a builder line and an assertion, not a
new JSON literal. Coverage of tags overall is the audit in `references/osm-coverage.md`.

## Footprint bands

`map/footprint.rs` — the strips linear geometry occupies on the ground, one construction
for every consumer: `Band { line, width, role }` built by `RoadLine::{deck_band,
curb_bands, passage_band}`, `WaterLine::channel_band` (`None` for culverts) and
`WallLine::band`. The width policy lives here too — `casing_width` (8%, 0.3–1 m) and
`bridge_curb_width` (12%, 0.8–2 m; ranges deliberately disjoint so a curb always
out-sticks a casing) — because a curb is not just paint: the same band blocks the
navmesh, and the drawn strip must match the blocked one by construction. Bands carry
the **centerline**, not a ready outline: the grid fill needs the centerline for its
4-connected-chain rasterization guarantee, the mesh build turns it into an outline, and
the renderer draws its own smoothed copy and takes only the widths (smoothing must not
move what blocks).

`CurbCoverage` also lives here: the shared *inputs* of the composite-bridge curb
decision — the bridge list and the joining-roads list, filtered by one `ways_joined`
(moved from `navigation`). The decision itself is deliberately NOT unified: the grid
blocks curb tiles by a directional outward probe, the mesh subtracts band polygons, and
both survive the "primary's nominal 16 m swallows its parallel sidewalk" trap in their
own way — a shared point-coverage test reproduces neither (with slack it opens the
composite's outer barrier, without slack it crumbles the curb chain into dashes). This
was analysed and rejected during the footprint extraction; re-attempting it means going
through the curb pin tests (`navmesh/tests.rs`) and the parity tests.

## Rendering

- **Merged meshes** (`map/meshing.rs` + `map/spawn.rs`, road layers in `map/roads.rs`,
  building layers in `map/buildings/`) — **one merged `Mesh2d` per layer** (parks, water,
  waterways, alleys, roads, building layers, walls): `MeshBuilder` triangulates polygons via
  `earcutr` (holes supported, degenerate contours skipped + counted) and emits per-vertex
  colors over a single white `ColorMaterial`. ~7000 buildings cost a handful of entities.
  Trees stay individual entities (see `references/trees.md`).
- **Ribbon** — a constant-width band along a polyline (`MeshBuilder::push_ribbon`), how
  every road, alley and kremlin wall is drawn. Two knobs, both named after their SVG /
  Mapnik counterparts: **join** (`Miter` — bisector offsets capped by `MITER_LIMIT`;
  `Round` — an arc of radius half-width on the **outer** side of the bend, the side where
  butt-ended segment quads leave a gap) and **cap** (`Butt` — cut at the last point;
  `Round` — a half-disc half-a-width past it). Arc tessellation is driven by
  `ARC_TOLERANCE` (5 cm of chord sagitta), so a 16 m primary gets more chords than a
  3.5 m footway; the **same tolerance decides whether a join fan is emitted at all** —
  a bend is skipped only when `half_width · turn` is under it. An angle threshold was
  tried first and was wrong: 5° on an alley still leaves a 15 cm slit, plainly visible
  as a pale cut across the road when zoomed in.
- **Junctions are not computed.** Overpass returns `out geom`, so shared node identity
  between ways is never available; roads are independent polylines drawn overlapping in
  one opaque single-colored layer. `Round` caps are what makes a junction *look* joined —
  the caps of the ways meeting at a node overlap into a rounded blob, exactly how
  osm-carto gets its smooth junctions (`stroke-linejoin: round` + `stroke-linecap:
  round`). This is why the road layer must stay opaque and flat-colored: transparency or
  a per-way tint would expose every crossing.
- **RoadStyle** (resource, BRP-writable, persisted; panel `ui/roads.rs` above Buildings)
  — how road ribbons are drawn; any change reruns `rebuild_roads` (despawn
  `RoadLayerTag` layers, respawn from the unchanged `MapData`). Three independent knobs:
  - **join** — `Square` (the historical `push_polyline`: an independent quad per segment
    with *both ends* extended by half a width; no joins at all, which is what produced
    the notches on bends and the wedges at junctions), `Miter`, `Round` (default).
  - **smoothing** — Chaikin corner-cutting on the centerline, `Off` (default) / 1 / 2
    iterations. Only bends over `MIN_SMOOTH_ANGLE` (10°) are cut and the cut length is
    clamped to the road width, so the drawn line never leaves the OSM data by more than
    a road width. `passage` roads are never smoothed — their endpoints are pinned to
    building outline vertices that `arch_openings` looks the arch up by. Off by default
    because OSM itself keeps its corners sharp.
  - **casing** — a darker outline, its own merged layer at `Z_ALLEY_CASING` (1.4) /
    `Z_ROAD_CASING` (1.9), width `+2·casing_width` (8% of the road, 0.3–1 m). Both fills
    (1.5 / 2.0) sit above both casings on purpose: otherwise a casing would cut every
    crossing in half. Off by default.

  Smoothing works on a **copy** — `RoadLine::points` and `width` are load-bearing for the
  navmesh (`bridge`/`passage` carves), arches, tree planting and the entrance generator,
  and none of them may shift because the drawing changed. `smooth_path` is shared with
  the rail layers; `centerline` is the road wrapper that adds the `passage` pin.
- **Bridge layers** (`map/roads.rs`, same `RoadLayerTag`) — a road with `bridge` leaves
  its class layers for the pair `bridge_casings` (`Z_BRIDGE_CASING` 2.1) + `bridges`
  (`Z_BRIDGE` 2.2): a gray **curb** (`BRIDGE_CURB_COLOR` 0.60, 12% of the width clamped
  0.8–2 m) under the fill in the class color. The 2GIS look — the curb bands along both
  deck edges are what makes a bridge read as a bridge, so the curb draws **always**,
  independent of `RoadStyle::casing`, and is both darker and thicker than a casing so
  the two never blend. Curb caps are always `Butt` (`push_bridge_curb`) — the deck ends
  in a square cut; a `Round` half-disc or the `Square` end-extension would poke a curb
  tongue past the bridge end. The deck sits above `Z_ROAD` so an overpass covers the
  street it crosses, and below `Z_RAIL` so a track on the bridge stays visible; curbs
  below fills for the casing reason (a junction of two bridge ways is never cut by a
  curb band). Street and footbridge fills share one mesh — bridge-over-bridge overlap
  is push order, rare enough not to warrant four layers. Rails carry no bridge flag —
  rail bridges are out of scope. The curb is not just paint: the navmesh blocks the
  same bands (see **Bridge curbs are impassable** in the navigation-deep skill).
- **Rail layers** (`map/roads.rs`, same file and the same `RoadLayerTag`, so a style
  change rebuilds them with the roads) — osm-carto's dashed railway, two merged meshes:
  a dark bed at `Z_RAIL` (2.4) and a white dash pattern at `Z_RAIL_DASH` (2.5), 6 m on /
  6 m off, dash width 60% of the bed. Two layers rather than one mesh, for the casing
  reason inverted: coplanar geometry z-fights, and the dashes must sit above *every*
  bed. Both above `Z_ROAD` (2) so a track lies on its street, not under it.
  `MeshBuilder::push_dashes` is the primitive — a single arclength pass emitting
  `Butt`-capped ribbon chunks, keeping the OSM vertices inside a dash so the pattern
  turns with the track. A way shorter than one dash still gets one, since most ways in a
  junction are short and a bare bed reads as a road. Tram ways are skipped here — they
  have their own module.
- **Tram** (`map/tram.rs`, its own module so a zoom-LOD step never rebuilds the
  road/rail meshes) — a thin blue line with perpendicular cross ties, the
  Yandex/2GIS convention; `TRAM_COLOR` is the only thing separating the two (Yandex dark
  red, 2GIS blue) and we take 2GIS's blue, since red on this map already means kremlin
  wall. Line and ties share one colour, so both go in one mesh (`TramLayerTag`, `Z_TRAM`
  2.6 — above the rail dashes at crossings, name `tram`) — self-overlap costs nothing,
  and there is no white dash layer for a tram. The tie primitive is
  `MeshBuilder::push_ticks`: the same arclength walk as `push_dashes`, but each mark is
  a perpendicular bar rather than a piece of the path, and the first one is offset half
  a step so a bar never lands exactly on a way endpoint and pairs into a cross at joins.
  The style is fixed, no panel and no resource: on a line 1.5–2 px wide a join style is
  invisible and Strong smoothing is indistinguishable from Light, so it is hardwired to
  `Round` + `Light` (`TRAM_JOIN` / `TRAM_SMOOTHING`), and the sparse tie spacing is
  baked into the LOD table.

  **Tram zoom LOD** (`TRAM_LODS`) — the mesh is rebuilt at discrete zoom thresholds,
  pseudo-gizmo style: five buckets over the camera zoom range, each with its own line
  width (targeting ~1.8 screen px, so the line neither fattens close up nor vanishes far
  out) and tie length/thickness/spacing (on-screen tie spacing never drops below ~10 px);
  the farthest bucket drops ties entirely, as 2GIS does at city scale. `TramZoomBucket`
  (resource, **not** persisted — zoom comes back from the camera's start view on every
  world entry: `START_ZOOM`, or the saved zoom under `position: save`) holds
  the current bucket index; `update_tram_zoom_bucket` recomputes it each Update frame
  from `PanCamera::zoom_factor` via `set_if_neq`, so `rebuild_tram` fires only on an
  actual threshold crossing, never per frame. The tram centerline is smoothed with a
  fixed `TRAM_SMOOTH_WIDTH` (1.2 m) clamp rather than the bucket's line width, so the
  path itself is identical across buckets and LOD switches don't wiggle the track.
  `RailLine::width` from parse is ignored for trams.
- **BuildingHeightMode** (resource, BRP-writable, persisted) — how a building's OSM
  height is drawn; any change reruns `rebuild_buildings` (despawn `BuildingLayerTag`
  layers, respawn from the unchanged `MapData::buildings`). The panel lives in
  `ui/buildings.rs`, bottom-right above the Trees panel, one cycling button. A building
  with no height uses `DEFAULT_BUILDING_HEIGHT` (15 m) everywhere. Modes:
  - **Facade** (default, the historical look) — pseudo-3D: the footprint polygon shifted
    straight down in a darker color at z just below the roof (`Z_FACADE` 4.9), visible
    only along south edges. Shift = height × `FACADE_SCALE` (0.2) clamped to 1.5–12 m, so
    a five-storey block keeps the historical 3 m band. Facades sit *under* every roof on
    purpose — that is what stops a tower's wide band from painting over its low neighbour.
  - **Shadows** — facade band plus a long shadow: one translucent merged mesh at
    `Z_BUILDING_SHADOW` (4.5 — *below* every building layer, so a neighbour's roof or
    wall masks the shadow and a shadow never lands on a same-height roof: the cheap
    stand-in for real height-aware casting; still above the portal and corpses, which
    are outdoors and in shadow by meaning). Per contiguous **silhouette chain** of the
    footprint (edges whose outward normal faces the 30° light — `map/mod.rs::SHADOW_DIR`,
    one source for building and tree shadows alike) one swept
    polygon `[chain, chain + offset reversed]`, offset = height × `SHADOW_LENGTH_SCALE`
    (0.6) clamped to 3–45 m. Not per-edge quads — on staircase facades those overlapped
    along the shadow axis and the translucency stacked into stripes; a chain sweep
    cannot self-intersect (a silhouette edge's perp-step equals `outward·d > 0`, so the
    chain is monotone along the shadow perpendicular). All sweeps of the map are then
    merged by a boolean union (`i_overlay`, NonZero — sweeps are winding-normalized
    first) into disjoint shapes-with-holes, so the translucent layer never overlaps
    itself anywhere: no double-darkening between wings of one block or neighbouring
    buildings (unlike tree shadows, which still stack).
  - **Shadows+tint** — shadows plus a roof color ramp: `t = sqrt(height / 60 m)` mixes
    the roof toward a darker muted tone (max 0.7); no-height buildings and the Kremlin
    keep their base color.
  - **2.5D (Extrusion)** — watabou-style: roof lifted up by height × `EXTRUDE_SCALE`
    (0.35) clamped to 2.5–30 m, south-facing wall quads (vertical gradient) fill the
    gap; courtyard north walls included. No facade band, no shadows. Depth is painter's
    algorithm *inside one mesh*: buildings sorted north-first (index-buffer order is
    raster order), so a southern building correctly overlays its northern neighbour.
    Known limits: units y-sort against flat z=5 and can draw over a tall roof they are
    "behind"; kremlin wall polylines (z 5.1) draw over nearby lifted roofs.
  - **2.5D+shadows+tint (ExtrusionShadowsTint)** — everything at once: the extruded
    geometry with the tint ramp on lifted roofs plus the long-shadow layer.
- **Arch rendering** (`buildings/arches.rs::arch_openings` + `push_wall_with_openings`) —
  a building `passage` (арка) is also cut out of the *drawn* building. The opening is a
  rectangle **in the wall plane**, found from the passage's **endpoints**, not by segment
  intersection: an OSM arch is typically mapped outline-vertex to outline-vertex (Tula
  way 485488257), so the road lies inside the building and only its ends touch walls. At
  such a shared vertex the opening is laid across **every** wall within `ARCH_WALL_TIE`
  (0.5 m) of the nearest one — clamped to a single edge it came out half a road wide.
  Width = the road's own width × |sin| of the entry angle, trimmed to the edge; height =
  `ARCH_HEIGHT` (6 real metres — 3 is physical but read as 2 px on a tall slab) as a
  fraction of *that building's* height, `band × 6/height`, never taller than the wall. In
  2.5D the wall is **really cut** (side pieces + a lintel above,
  `push_wall_with_openings`) so the layers beneath — the road running through, the
  ground — show through the hole, and `shadow_builder` patches the opening with
  `SHADOW_COLOR` (the lintel shades it; without the patch the hole glows). In facade
  modes the facade band is one earcut polygon, so the opening is *painted* in shaded
  ground colour instead — a stated compromise. What the passage does to the navmesh is
  in the navigation-deep skill.
